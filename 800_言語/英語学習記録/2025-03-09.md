最初の20時間 — あらゆることをサクッと学ぶ方法 | ジョシュ・カウフマン | TEDxCSU
https://youtu.be/5MgBikgcWnY?si=2joe_GFThI-kKVgG

Hi everyone.
はい、皆さん。

Two year ago, my life changed forever.
2年前、私の生活は一変しました。

My wife Kelsey and I welcomed our daughter Lela into the world.
妻ケルシーと私は娘リラをこの世に迎えました。

Now, becoming a parent is an amazing experience.
親になることは素晴らしい経験です。

Your whole world changes over night.
世界が一夜にして変わりました。

And all of your priorities change immediately.
そして、すべての優先順位がすぐに変わりました。

So fast that it makes it really difficult to process sometimes.
とても速いあまりにも 処理するのが難しい

Now, you also have to learn a tremendous amount about being a parent like, for example, how to dress your child.
非常に多くのことを学ばなければならない 親であることについて 例えば 子供への洋服の着せ方

This was new to me.
これは初めてだ 私にとって

This is an actual outfit, I thought this was a good idea.
これは実際の衣装、私はこれは良いアイデアだと思った

And even Lela knows that it's not a good idea.
リラもこれは良くないと知っていた

So there is so much to learn and so much craziness all at once.
だから、学ぶことはたくさんある また 多くのバカげたことが一気に起こった

And to add to the craziness, Kelsey and I both work from home, we're entrepreneurs, we run our own businesses.
狂気に拍車をかける、ケルシーと私は共に家で働く、私たちは起業家です、私たちは自分たちでビジネスする。

So, Kelsey develops courses online for yoga teachers.
そして、ケルシーはオンラインコースを開発している ヨガ先生向けの

I'm an author.
私は作家だ。

And so, I'm working from home, Kelsey's working from home.
私は家で働いている、ケルシーも家で働いている。

We have an infant and we're trying to make sure that everything gets done that needs done.
私たちには乳児がいる そして 私たちは次のことを確認しようとしている やるべきことはすべてやる

And life is really, really busy.
そして 生活は本当に忙しい

And a couple of weeks into this amazing experience, when the sleep deprivation really kicked in, like around week eight, I had this thought,
この素晴らしい経験を初めて数週間、睡眠不足が本格化したとき、8週目あたりから 私はこう考えた

and it was the same thought that parents across the ages, internationally, everybody has had this thought, which is:
それは時代を超えて親たちが抱いている思いと同じだ、国際的に、誰もがこう思っただろう それは

I am never going to have free time ever again.
私は決して来ない 自由な時間は もう二度と

Somebody said it's true.
誰かが言った それは正しい

It's not exactly true, but it feels really, really true in that moment.
それは正確には正しくない しかし それは本当にそう感じる 本当に正しい その瞬間は

And this was really disconcerning to me, because one of the things that I enjoy more than anything else is learning new things.
そしてそれは本当に不愉快だった 私にとって、なぜなら そのひとつが 私にとって何よりも楽しいのは 新しいことを学ぶ

Getting curious about something and diving in and fidding around and learning through trial and error.
何かに興味を持ち飛び込んでみる そしてあちこち見て回り 試行錯誤して学んでいく

And eventually becoming pretty good at something.
いずれ かなり良くなる

And without this free time, I didn't know how I was ever going to do that ever again.
この自由な時間がなければ もう二度とあんなことはできないと思っていた

And so, I'm a big geek, I want to keep learning things, I want to keep growing.
そう、私は大のオタクだ 維持したい 学ぶことを 私は成長を続けたい

And so what I've decided to do was, go to the library, and go to the bokstore, and look at what research says about how we learn and how we learn quickly.
だから 私が決めたことは 図書館へ行く そして書店へ行く そして見つける 私たちがどのように学ぶかについて 私たちがどのように迅速に学ぶか

And I read bunch of books, I read a bunch of websites.
私は大量の本を読んだ 私は大量のWebサイトを読んだ

And tried to answer this question, how long does it take to acquire a new skill?
この問題の答えを試した どのくらい長いか？ 新しいスキルを習得するのに

You know what I found?
あなたは知っている？ 私の見つけた答えを？

10,000 hours!
1万時間！

Anybody ever heard this?
誰かこれを聞いたことがありますか？

The 10,000 hour rule
1万時間の法則

It takes 10,000 hours. If you want to learn something new, if you want to be good at it, it's going to take 10,000 hours to get there.
それは1万時間かかる。もしあなたが何か新しいことを学びたいとき、もしあなたがそれにうまくなりたいとき、それは1万時間かかるだろう そこに行くために

And I read this in book after book, in website after website.
私は読んだ あらゆる本で、あらゆるWebサイトで

And my mental experience of reading all of this stuff was like:
これらすべてを読む私の精神的な経験はおそらく

No!!
無理！

I didn't have time! I don't have 10,0000 hours.
私には時間がない！ 私には1万時間なんてない

I am never going to be able to learn anything new.
私はもう来ないだろう 新しいことを学ぶことは

Ever again.
もう二度と

But that's not true.
しかしそれは正しくない

So, 10,000 hours, just to give you a rough order of magnitude, 10,000 hours is a full-time job for five years.
1万時間、おおよその規模間をお伝えする、1万時間はフルタイム5年分

That's a long time.
それはすごく長い

And we've all had the experience of learning something new, and it didn't take us anywhere close to that amount of time, right?
私たちはみんな経験している 新しいことを学ぶこと そして それはそんなに時間がかかってない

So, what's up? There's something kinda funky going on here.
どういうこと？ ここではちょっと変わったことが起こっている

What the research says and what we expect, and have experiences, they don't match up.
研究結果が言っていることと私たちが期待すること そして経験してきたこと それらは一致していない

And what I found, here's the wrinkle:
私が見つけたこと、ここにひねりがある

The 10,000 hour rule came out of studies of expert-level performance.
1万時間の法則は来ている プロレベルのパフォーマンスの研究結果から

There's a professor at Florida State University, his name is K. Anders Ericsson.
専門家がいる フロリダ大学に 彼の名はKアンダース・エリクソン

He is the originator of the 10,000 hour rule.
彼は1万時間の提唱者

And where that came from is, he studied professional athletes, world class musicians, chess grand masters.
そして、それはそこから来た、彼は学んだ プロアスリート、世界クラスミュージシャン、チェスのグランドマスター

All of this ultra competitive folks in ultra-high performing fileds.

And he tried to figure out how long does it take to get to the top of those kinds of fields.

そして、そのような分野でトップに立つにはどれくらいの時間がかかるのかを考えようとした。

And what he found is, the more deliberate practice, the more time that those individuals spend practicing the elements of whatever it is that they do, the more time you spend, the better you get.

And the folks at the tippy top of their fields put in around 10,000 hours of practice.

Now, we were talking about the game of telephone a little bit earlier.

Here's what happened:

an author by the name of Malcolm Gladwell wrote a book in 2007 called "Outliers: The Story of Success", and the central piece of that book was the 10,000 hour rule.

Practice a lot, practice well, and you will do extremely well, you will reach the top of your field.

So, the message, what Dr.Ericsson was actually saying is, it takes 10,000 hours to get at the top of an ultra competitive field in a very narrow subject, that's what that means.

But here's what happened: ever since Outliers came out, immediately came out, reached the top of best seller lists, stayed there for three solid months.

All of a sudden the 10,000 hour rule was everywhere.

And a society-wide game of telephone started to be played.

So this message, it takes 10,000 hours to reach the top of an ultra competitive field, became, it takes 10,000 hours to became an expert at something, which became, it takes 10,000 hours to become good at something, which became, it takes 10,000 hours to learn something.

But that last statement, it takes 10,000 hours to learn something, is not true. It's not true.

So, what the research actually says: The learning curve

I spent a lot of time here at the CSU library in the cognitive psychology stacks cause I'm a geek.

And when you actually look at the studies of skill acquisition, you see over and over a graph like this.

Now, researchers, whether they're studying a motor skill, something you do physically or a mental skill, they like to study things that they can time.

Cause you can quantify that, right?

So, they'll give research participants a little task, something that requires physical arrangement, or something that requires learning a little mental trick, and they'll time how long a participant takes to complete the skill.

And here's what this graph says, when you start --

so when researchers gave participants a task, it took them a really long time, cause it was new and they were horrible.

With a little bit of practice, they get better and better and better.

And that early part of practice is really, really efficient.

People get good at things with just a little bit of practice.

Now, what's interesting to note is that, for skills that we want to learn for ourselves, we don't care so much about time, right?

We just care about how good we are, whatever good happens to mean.

So if we relabel performance time to how good you are, the graph flips, and you get his famous and widely known, this is the learning curve.

And the story of the learning curve is when you start, you're grossly incompetent and you know it, right?

With a little bit of practice, you get really good, really quick.

So that early level of improvement is really fast.

And then at a certain point you reach a plateau, and the subsequent games become much harder to get, they take more time to get.

Now, my question is, I want that, right?

How long does it take from starting something and being grossly incompetent and knowing it to being reasonably good?

In hopefully, as short a period of time as possible.

So, how long does that take?

Here's what my research says: 20 hours.

That's it. You can go from knowing nothing about any skill that you can think of.

Want to learn a language? Want to learn how to draw?

Want to learn how to juggle flaming chainsaws?

If you put 20 hours of focused deliberate practice into that thing, you will be astounded.

Astounded at how good you are.

20 hours is doable, that's about 45 minutes a day for about a month.

Even skipping a couple days, here and there.

20 hours isn't that hard to accumulate.

Now, there's a method to doing this.

Because it's not like you can just start fiddling around for about 20 hours and expect these massive improvements.

There's a way to practice intelligently.

There's a way to practice efficiently, that will make sure that you invest those 20 hours in the most effective way that you possibly can.

And here's the mothod, it applies to anything:

Deconstruct

The first is to deconstruct the skill.

Decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done, and then look into the skill and break it down into smaller pieces.

Most of the things that we think of as skills are actually big bundles of skills that require all sorts of different things.

The more you can break apart the skill, the more you're able to decide, what are the parts of this skill that would actually help me get to what I want?

And then you can practice those first.

And if you practice the most important things first, you'll be able to improve your performance in the least amount of time possible.

The seconds is, learn enough to self correct.

So, get three to five resources about what it is you're trying to learn.

Could be book, could be DVDs, could be courses, could be anything.

But don't use those as a way to procrastinate on practice.

I know I do this, right?

Get like 20 books about the topic, like, "I'm going to start learning how to program a computer when I complete these 20 books".

No. That's procrastination.

What you want to do is learn just enough that you can actually practice and self correct or self edit as you practice.

So the learning becames a way of getting better at noticing when you're making a mistake and then doing something a little different.

The third is to remove barriers to practice.

Distractions, television, internet.

All of these things that get in the way of you actually sitting down and doing the work.

And the more you're able to use just a little bit of willpower to remove the distractions that are keeping you from practicing, the more likely you are to actually sit down and practice, right?

And the fourth is to practice for at least 20 hours.

Now, most skills have what I call a frustration barrier.

You know, the grossly-incompetent and knowing it part?

That's really, really frustrating. We don't like to feel stupid.

And feeling stupid is a barrier to us actually sitting down adn doing the work.

So, by pre-committing to practicing whatever it is that you want to do for at least 20 hours, you will be able to overcome that initial frustration barrier and stick with the practice long enough to actually reap the rewards.

That's it! it's not rocket science.

Four very simple steps that you can use to learn anything.

Now, this is easy to talk about in theory, but it's more fun to talk about in practice.

So one of the things that I've wanted to learn how to do for a long time is play the ukulele.

Has anybody seen Jake Shimabukuro's TED Talk where he plays the ukulele and makes it sound like he's like a ukulele god.

It's amazing.

I saw it, I was like, "That is so cool!"

It's such a neat instrument. I would really like to learn how to play.

And so I decided that to test this theory.

I wanted to put 20 hours into practicing ukulele and see where it got.

And so the first thing about playing the ukulele is, in order to practice, you have to one, right?

So, I got an ukulele and My lovely assistant?

Thank you sir. I think I need the chord here.

It's not just an ukulele, it's an electric ukulele.

So, the first couple hours are just like the first couple hours of anything.

You have to get the tools that you are using to practice.

You have to make sure they're available.

My ukulele didn't come with strings attached.

I had to figure out how to put those on.

Like, that's kind of important, right?

And learning how to tune, learning how to make sure that all of the things that need to be done in order to start practicing get done, right?

Now, one of the things when I was ready to actually start practicing

was I looked in online databases and songbooks for how to play songs.

And they say, okay, ukulele, you can play more than one string at a time, so you can play chords, that's cool, you are accompanying yourself, you.

And when I started looking at songs, I had an ukulele chord book that had like hundreds of chords.

Looking at this and "Wow, that's intimidating".

But when you lok at the actual songs, you see the same chords over and over, right?

As it turns out, playing the ukulele is kind of like doing anything, There's a very small set of things that are really important and techniques that you'll use all the time.

And in most songs you'll use four, maybe five chords, and that's it, that's the song.

You don't have to know handreds, as long as you know the four or the five.

So, while I was doing my research, I found a wonderful little medley of pop songs by a band called Axis of Awesome.

And what Axis of Awesome says is that you can learn, or you can play pretty much any pop song of the past five decades, if you know four chords, and those chords are G, D, Em and C.

Four chords pump out every pop song ever, right?

So I thought, this is cool!

I would like to play every pop song ever.

So, that was the first song I decided to learn, and I would like to actually share it with you. Ready?

Thank you.

I love that song.

And I have a secret to share with you.

So, by playing that song for you, I just hit my twentieth hour of practicing the ukulele.

And so it's amazing, pretty much anything that you can think of, what do you want to do.

The major barrier to learn something new is not intellectual, it's not the process of you learning a bunch of little tips or tricks or things.

The major barrier's emotional. We're scared.

Feeling stupid doesn't feelgood, in the beginning of learning anything new you feel really stupid.

So the major barrier's not intellectual, it's emotional.

But put 20 hours into anything.

It doesn't matter. What do you want to learn?

Do you want to learn a language? Want to learn how to cook?

Want to learn how to draw?

What turns you on? What lights you up?

Go out and do taht thing. It only takes 20 hours.

Have fun.
